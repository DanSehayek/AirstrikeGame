While you are guided through the controls in the tutorial: I have listed them here as well:

Arrow keys to move
Spacebar to shoot
A_key to activate special ability

Created using Python version 3.4.0 with the appropriate version of Pygame.

Note: If you do not have Python and Pygame installed on your computer but would like to play the game: I would recommend downloading all of the files in the AirstrikeExecutables repository.
